Repository for Big Data (BUSN 41201) Final Project - "Hotel Reservation Cancellations: An Analytical Approach to Understanding and Modeling Customer Behavior"

Co-Authors: Tina Tong, Jingxuan Zhang, Michael Han, Emil Perdue, Alexander Vattakkattu

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a 'Hotel Reservation Dataset'1 to gain insights into customer cancellation behavior and its underlying factors. By examining various aspects related to hotel reservations, including market segments, booking preferences, and previous cancellation patterns, we aimed to identify the types of customers more likely to cancel their reservations and explore predictive models to assist hotels in flagging such users.

We first focus on the factors that affect the hotelâ€™s pricing. Our second question explores the differences in booking preferences and behaviors among distinct market segments, such as business travelers, families, and couples. Next, we focused on developing predictive models to accurately forecast reservation cancellations and identify potential cancellations in advance. Finally, we looked at which variables in our predictive model might be causally related to hotel cancellation.
